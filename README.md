# Ignore

Used to make a .gitignore file that looks something like this, used for competitive programming.

```Text
.gitignore
A.cpp
B.cpp
C.cpp
D.cpp
E.cpp
F.cpp
G.cpp
H.cpp
I.cpp
J.cpp
K.cpp
L.cpp
M.cpp
N.cpp
O.cpp
P.cpp
Q.cpp
R.cpp
S.cpp
T.cpp
U.cpp
V.cpp
W.cpp
X.cpp
Y.cpp
Z.cpp
```

I use this to ignore competitive program solutions that I don't finish during the contest as I make all that files I might need prior to the contest.
