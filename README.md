# Ignore

Script used to make a .gitignore file that looks something like this

```
.gitignore
A.cc
B.cc
C.cc
D.cc
E.cc
F.cc
G.cc
H.cc
I.cc
J.cc
K.cc
L.cc
M.cc
N.cc
O.cc
P.cc
Q.cc
R.cc
S.cc
T.cc
U.cc
V.cc
W.cc
X.cc
Y.cc
Z.cc
```

I use this to ignore competitive program solutions that I don't finish during the contest as I make all that files I might need prior to the contest
